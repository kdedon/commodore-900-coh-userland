/*
 * locktest2.c - cross-process contention test for the hrgui drawing lock.
 *
 * Runs on the hi-res JS emulator (the VRAM tail is mapped user-accessible into
 * every process, so it holds the shared lock word AND this test's shared state
 * -- no GUI, no driver needed for the baseline spin lock).  Forks NPROC
 * contenders; each, NITER times, acquires the lock, marks itself the sole
 * owner, holds across a window wide enough to be scheduler-preempted, then
 * checks nobody else got in, and releases.
 *
 * Correct mutual exclusion  => viol == 0  AND  count == NPROC*NITER.
 * A spin lock whose budget expires while the (preempted) holder cannot run will
 * "proceed best-effort" -- two processes in the section at once -> viol > 0 and
 * lost counter updates.
 *
 * Result is written to /lockout (the hi-res console is the framebuffer, so we
 * report via a file and extract it with disk.py).
