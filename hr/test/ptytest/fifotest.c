/*
 * fifotest.c - reproduce the hrgui event-pipe handshake in isolation.
 *
 * zview answers each client over a NAMED pipe the client makes for itself:
 * the client mknod()s /tmp/hrc<pid>, opens it for READING and blocks; the
 * server then opens it for WRITING, unlink()s it immediately, and writes a
 * 16-byte event.  With two clients, whichever one the server answers SECOND
 * never sees its reply and blocks forever -- so reproduce exactly that shape
 * with no graphics, no server and no window system in the way.
 *
 * Prints one line per child: "child N got <count>".  A healthy run reports 16
 * for every child; a hang reports nothing for the starved one.
