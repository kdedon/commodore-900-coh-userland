/*
 * clgfx.c - hrgui client-side direct-render draw library (GUI.md Model A).
 *
 * The client blits its own content straight to VRAM (segments 0x3A/0x3B) through
 * the salvaged engine bitblt -- the SAME asm blitter the server uses, so a whole
 * glyph row is shifted into place in one masked word op (never per-pixel).  It
 * clips to the visible-region list the server publishes in the shared VRAM tail
 * (shmem.h), read under a seqlock.  Fonts live in the tail too, so nothing is
 * relinked and no pixel or glyph ever crosses IPC.
 *
 * Only bitblt + its asm inner loops + rmath (R_point_in) + masks (texture[]) +
 * globals (BLT_* state) are pulled from libhrgfx here -- NOT the server-only
 * layer/clip/daemon code.  Blits go to a client-local `display' BITMAP based at
 * SEG0 (offset 0), the path proven safe in the server (a mid-VRAM destination
 * base faults in this toolchain; a SEG0-based dest spans the 512-line split
 * fine, since the emulator's VRAM is contiguous across it).
