 * hrapp.c - hrgui client start-up (see inc/hrapp.h for the contract).
 *
 * One function, hr_open(), replaces the old "the server hands the client its
 * window id, size and cell metrics on the command line" arrangement: the client
 * declares what it wants, the server answers with what it got.  That moves every
 * per-application property (title, size, icon, resizability) OUT of the server's
 * catalog file and into the application itself, which is what lets an app be
 * started with a bare argv.
 *
 * hr_open() also parses the options every GUI application shares (-T -I -S -P
 * -H, see hrapp.h) and finds the client's event channel whether it was forked by
 * the server or started from a shell (openev below).  Between them, a desktop
 * layout is a shell script rather than server code.
 *
 * Linked into every GUI client alongside clgfx.o (Makefile CLGFX).
