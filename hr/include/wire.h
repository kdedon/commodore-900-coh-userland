 * wire.h - hrgui client <-> server wire protocol (GUI.md Phase 1, server-render).
 *
 * Transport:
 *   - ONE shared command pipe, client -> server.  Every client (and the input
 *     pump) inherits its write end at fork; the server owns the read end and
 *     blocks on it -- so the whole system waits on a single read(), no select()
 *     needed (GUI.md sec 3.5 doorbell, sec 4.4).  Records are fixed size and
 *     small (<= PIPE_BUF), so concurrent writers interleave atomically.
 *   - A per-window RING in the shared VRAM tail, server -> client, for expose,
 *     resize, routed input and the quit notice (inc/shmem.h SHM_EVQ).  This is
 *     GUI.md sec 3.4's shared-VRAM ring, and it replaced the per-client event
 *     pipe: on this kernel a pipe is a file, so a pipe cost block allocation and
 *     buffer-cache traffic per event, and the FIFO a shell-started client had to
 *     mknod for itself was not even reliable.  The connect acknowledgement comes
 *     through shmem.h SHM_ACK, because until it arrives a client does not know
 *     which ring is its own.
 *
 * Rule zero still holds: only control records travel between processes, never
 * pixels (GUI.md sec 3.2).
 *
 * Coordinates in draw commands are WINDOW-RELATIVE (0,0 = content origin); the
 * server adds the physical origin and clips (GUI.md sec 2.10).

/* ---- the dialog-open record (client -> server, C_DLGOPEN) ----------------- *
 * A connected client asks for a MODAL DIALOG OVERLAY: the server saves the
 * pixels under a centred box, draws the frame (1px border + the window-style
 * stepped drop shadow; dialogs are untitled), publishes the interior as a
 * drawable surface (shmem.h SHM_DLGSURF), and routes ALL input to this client
 * as E_D* events until C_DLGCLOSE.  Every other client is frozen meanwhile
 * (hr_glob()->overlay = OV_DLG|wid), and so is this client's own window --
 * only the dialog surface may be drawn.
 *
 * Exactly 2 * sizeof(WMSG); first two shorts overlay wm_type/wm_wid so the
 * server's fixed-size reader dispatches it like any command and consumes the
 * one continuation record (one 32-byte write() <= PIPE_BUF, atomic).  Unlike
 * HRCONN the second short is a WID, not a pid: the requester is connected by
 * definition and stamps the id it was granted.
 *
 * The answer is E_DLGOPEN on the requester's ring: arg0 = 1 and the granted
 * interior size (the server may clamp), or arg0 = 0 = refused (another dialog
 * is already up -- there is at most ONE in the system).  Every request gets
 * exactly one answer, so the requester may block for it. */

/* ---- application entries in the window menu (hc_menu, HRAPP ha_menu) ------ *
 * There is no menu bar in this GUI: a window's only menu is the right-button
 * pop-up the server puts up over it, and the server owns it (it is drawn as an
 * overlay while every client is frozen, so a client could not draw one itself).
 * So an application that wants commands of its own DECLARES them here, as bits,
 * and the server puts the corresponding standard entries at the TOP of that
 * window's menu, then a divider, then the usual window operations.
 *
 * The labels and their order are fixed -- that is the point: "Save" sits in the
 * same place with the same wording in every application, which no per-app string
 * list would give.  An application that needs something outside this vocabulary
 * puts it in its own content, not in the window menu.
 *
 * Picking one sends E_MENU with the bit in arg0, and nothing else: the server
 * does not know what "Save" means to the client, it only routes the click.  The
 * bits are what a client declared, so it can dispatch on them directly.
 *
 * "Find" and "Search" are not synonyms and a client should declare only one of
 * them: Find GOES TO a thing the document already names (a page, a record, an
 * entry picked from a list); Search looks for TEXT the user types, walks the
 * hits, and -- in a client that can rewrite its content -- offers Replace on
 * the same dialog.  Editors want Search. */

 * is forwarded ONLY in between.  So a client sees the whole press-drag-release
 * gesture it needs to track a selection, and the server never streams motion at
 * a client that is not dragging -- pointless traffic that would just overflow a
 * ring whose owner is not listening for it.
 *
 * E_PASTE is the middle-click "insert the selection here".  It goes to the window
 * UNDER THE POINTER and does NOT raise it: pasting into a partly covered window
 * must not restack the desktop, which is the whole point of the gesture.  The

 * actually does (X11 calls this SelectionClear).
 *
 * A PASTE clears it too: once the text has been delivered the gesture is over,
 * so the server sends E_SELCLEAR to the owner and forgets it.

 * close, which subsumes anything dropped meanwhile).
 *
 * Coordinates are DIALOG-INTERIOR-relative.  E_DBUTTON follows E_BUTTON's
 * grab shape: a left press INSIDE the interior starts it, motion is forwarded
 * only while the button is held, and the release always arrives -- with
 * coordinates deliberately UNCLAMPED, because a button widget disarms by
