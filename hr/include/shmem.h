 * shmem.h - hrgui shared-data segment layout (GUI.md sec 1.3 / 2.9 / 3.6).
 *
 * The shared GUI data lives in its OWN MMU segment, GDS = 0x38 (kernel
 * machine.h), 28 KB, mapped USER-ACCESSIBLE into every process (attribute
 * 0x00, exactly like the bitmap segments -- GUI.md sec 1.2), so it is the one
 * shared memory this V7 kernel has.  WHERE it sits physically is a video-card
 * property that userland never sees: on the hi-res card it is the spare tail
 * of the framebuffer RAM (the card decodes 128 KB, the visible 1024x800 1bpp
 * bitmap uses only 100 KB, so phys 0x3F9000..0x3FFFFF is free), and the
 * card's console driver points GDS there at init (hrtty portst_); a different
 * card's driver maps whatever spare RAM it has instead.  Everything here is
 * addressed as HRTAIL + offset, i.e. offset 0 of segment 0x38.
 * hrgui uses it for READ-MOSTLY shared data only:
 *   - the system font(s), loaded once by the server from the .hf files in /usr/hr/fonts, so
 *     the server AND every direct-render client blit glyphs from a single copy
 *     with no relink and no kernel trap;
 *   - the per-window clip descriptors, so a client can clip its own drawing to
 *     the visible parts of its window (direct-render, Model A).
 * Pixels go straight to the framebuffer and control/events stay on pipes;
 * neither travels through here.  Budget (of 28 KB): fonts hold 12 KB reserved;
 * the tables below (globals, clip descriptors, locks, selection, acks, event
 * rings, dialog surface, window list) end at 0x5662, leaving ~6.4 KB spare.

 * raises `stacking' inside srvlock, DRAINS these to 0 before it restacks.  That
 * is a two-flag (Dekker) handshake on `stacking' plus a drain: given ordered
 * stores (this in-order CPU is sequentially consistent), a fast-path blit and a
 * restacking op can never overlap, so a stale-clip client can never scribble a
 * window the server is covering -- WITHOUT the fast path ever taking the lock.
 * Single writer per byte, so no atomic is needed (this V7 CPU has only TSET).
 * Reached through hr_setdraw/hr_getdraw (hrlock.c) so the store doubles as the
 * ordering barrier before the client reads `stacking' and the server's repeated
 * load in the drain loop cannot be hoisted -- this K&R compiler has no volatile.

/* ---- CLIPBOARD (window-menu Copy / Paste) -------------------------------- *
 * The SECOND clipboard, and deliberately nothing like the first.  PRIMARY above
 * is a gesture: you select, you middle-click, and it is over -- the server takes
 * the highlight away on the paste (wire.h E_SELCLEAR) and the next drag anywhere
 * on the desktop replaces the contents.  That is exactly right for "put this
 * there, now", and exactly wrong for carrying a piece of text around while you
 * keep working, which is what the window menu's Copy and Paste are for.
 *
 * So the clipboard is a plain FILE and that is the whole of it: no header in the
 * tail, no lock, no owner, no generation, no expiry.  Copy puts bytes in it and
 * they stay -- through any number of Pastes, through every selection made in the
 * meantime, through the owning application exiting.  Nothing whatsoever is
 * shared with the PRIMARY store: a different file, a different code path and no
 * common lock, so neither mechanism can disturb the other.  (The bodies cannot
 * collide either: PRIMARY's is HRSEL_PFX<pid>, this one is a fixed name.)
 *
 * Publishing is made atomic by link/unlink rather than by a lock.  The writer
 * streams into HRCLIP_NEW<pid> and swaps that into place only once it is
 * complete, so a reader holding the file open goes on reading the bytes it
 * started with -- the old inode outlives the unlink -- and a paste can never
 * splice the tail of one Copy onto the head of the next.  The one gap is a
 * reader that opens in the instant between the unlink and the link: it finds
 * nothing and pastes nothing.  At human speed that is a theoretical loss, and
 * unlike a torn paste it is a harmless one.
 *
 * A paste therefore always calls hr_cliplen() first and then hr_clipread() from
 * offset 0 -- the same shape as the PRIMARY reader's loop -- because it is
 * hr_cliplen() that opens and PINS the snapshot the reads then stream. */

/* ---- connect acknowledgements ------------------------------------------- *
 * The server answers a C_CONNECT with E_CONNECTED over the client's event
 * pipe.  For a client the server FORKED that pipe is an anonymous pipe(2) and
 * is completely reliable.  For a client started from a shell (the desktop rc)
 * it is a named pipe the client mknod'd, and that channel has proved NOT to be
 * reliable: with two such clients starting together the server opens the right
 * inode (verified by fstat on both ends) and write() returns 16, yet the second
 * client never sees a byte -- it re-read for 30 s and got nothing.  The result
 * was a window that exists but is never drawn.
 *
 * So the ACK does not travel that way any more.  The server also publishes it
 * here, in the tail -- the one shared medium in this system that is known
 * solid -- and the client takes whichever arrives first.  The pipe is still
 * used for everything afterwards (expose/resize/input); this only removes the

/* ---- per-window event rings (server -> client) --------------------------- *
 * This REPLACES the per-client event pipe.  A pipe was the wrong medium here:
 * on this kernel a pipe IS a file (coh/pipe.c pread/pwrite call fread/fwrite on
 * the inode), so every event cost block allocation and buffer-cache traffic,
 * launching a client cost a mknod + unlink in /tmp, and the channel needed a
 * writable filesystem.  It was also unreliable in exactly the case that matters
 * -- see [SHM_ACK above].  Events are small, fixed-size and control-rate: they
 * belong in the shared tail, like everything else here.
 *
 * One ring per window, SINGLE producer (the server) and SINGLE consumer (that
 * window's client), so no lock is needed -- just ordered stores, which this
 * in-order CPU gives (the same argument SHM_INDRAW rests on).  eq_head and
 * eq_tail free-run and are masked, so the ring holds EVQ_SLOTS events and the
 * wrap is a mask, not a divide (GUI.md sec 3.7).
 *
 * A FULL ring cannot block the server -- that was the old sendev() hazard which
 * forced the qexpose/flushexp deferral.  It sets eq_over instead and drops the
 * event; the client treats "I overflowed" as "repaint everything", which for
 * E_EXPOSE is exactly the right semantics anyway.
 *
 * Blocking is the one thing shared memory cannot do by itself: a client must
 * SLEEP when its ring is empty (there is no select(), and busy-polling would
 * burn the whole 6 MHz CPU).  So the driver provides a doorbell, CIOEVWAIT /
 * CIOEVWAKE, used exactly like the drawing-lock futex: the kernel is entered
 * only when a client actually has to block, and an event that is already queued
 * costs NO system call at all.  eq_wait says a consumer is asleep, so the server
 * only traps when there is really someone to wake.
 *
 * EVQ_CONNECT is a 17th ring used only for the handshake: a client has no window
 * id yet, so it cannot wait on its own ring.  The server bumps this one after
 * publishing an ack (SHM_ACK) and the client re-checks the table. */
