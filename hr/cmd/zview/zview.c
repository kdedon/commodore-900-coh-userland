/*
 * zview.c - the ZView window server (GUI.md Phase 1).
 *
 * A single userland process that owns every pixel.  It draws through the
 * salvaged rendering engine libhrgfx (which it links), keeps the per-window
 * WSTRUCT/LAYER table, and does clipping / z-order / damage entirely with the
 * engine's layer.c primitives -- so "redraw correctly when partially covered"
 * comes straight from make_vis_list()/perform_update(), not from new code here.
 *
 * It replaces the old jlib/coroutine/per-daemon stack (GUI.md sec 0) with:
 *   - ONE blocking read() on a shared command pipe (all clients + the input
 *     pump write to it); no select(), no coroutines (GUI.md sec 3.5, 4.4).
 *   - a per-client event pipe for expose/quit/input.
 *   - fork+exec client launch with inherited pipe fds (GUI.md sec 3.3).
 *
 * The engine's damage path (layer.c perform_update -> sendmsg) is captured by
 * gfx_reply_hook and turned into E_EXPOSE events to the affected client, which
 * repaints (redraw-on-expose, GUI.md sec 2.10).
 *
 * Nothing about the desktop's contents is compiled in: the catalog
 * /usr/hr/etc/apps (loadapps) names what the right-click desktop menu offers,
 * and the shell script /usr/hr/etc/rc (runrc) starts anything the user wants
 * resident from power-on -- normally at least the dock (zdock), the separate
 * "shell" of this desktop: the server manages windows, the dock manages the
 * icon bar and app launching, and either survives without the other (the
 * kernel-and-shell split).  An app declares its own window when it connects
 * (wire.h HRCONN), and may be started either by us or straight from a shell.
