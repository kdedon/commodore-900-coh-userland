# project.mk - the vellum sheet-set Makefile skeleton; vellum(1) FILES
# names it and what its targets gate.
# A new design starts with a copy, the way a new title block already does:
#	cp /usr/vellum/etc/project.mk Makefile
# then set SHEETS.  check: and drift: gate print: and ps: the way cc gates
# on -Werror -- no paper moves until the set proves out and the changes
# since the approved revision have been looked at.
#
# Every tool named below is HEADLESS: the editor is a hi-res graphics
# client, but nothing here is, so a set builds on a machine with no
# bitmap card, over a serial line, from cron.  That is why the drawing
# tool and the drawing TOOLS are different programs.
