# library.mk - a stencil LIBRARY as a build product; vellum(1) FILES
# names it, and velsym(1) is the converter it drives.
# The companion of project.mk: that one makes a drawing SET prove out
# before paper moves, this one makes the stencils a shop draws WITH a
# thing that is built, checked and revised like everything else.
#
#	cp /usr/vellum/etc/library.mk Makefile
#
# then set LIB and the stencil list.  Nothing here is a new mechanism:
# a stencil SKETCH is an ordinary drawing, so it opens in the editor,
# prints, velpic's into the manual, and takes the whole revision
# workflow (rev:/drift:/review: in project.mk) unchanged.  The shop's
# stencils get revision control because they are drawings.
#
# The worked example is the one that ships: /usr/vellum/eg/sk holds the
# nine sketches that BUILD /usr/vellum/sym/pid.sym, and `make pid.sym'
# below reproduces that library byte for byte, which is how the
# converter proves itself.

V=/usr/vellum/bin
SK=/usr/vellum/eg/sk
LIB=pid.sym

# The library's own header comment is a FILE ($(SK)/HEADER), not an
# echoed line: make(1) eats a # to end of line even inside a recipe,
# so a comment a Makefile wants to WRITE has to arrive from a file.

# The sketches are drawn at -scale 4 (one drawing unit IS one quarter
# unit) so a hand-cut stencil's detail is available, and -org names the
# grid point that becomes the symbol origin -- the point it snaps by.
# A sketch whose FIRST N marker is the origin needs no -org at all.
