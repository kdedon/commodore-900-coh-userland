 * zterm.c - a ZView terminal-emulator client (GUI.md Phase 2).
 *
 * A plain process (no jlib, no coroutines) that gives a window a real shell:
 *   - declares the window it wants (title, 80x25 cells' worth of pixels, icon)
 *     to the server with hr_open() and is told its window id and granted
 *     content size back -- nothing comes in on the command line;
 *   - allocates a pseudo-terminal pair (/dev/ptyp<n> master + /dev/ttyp<n>
 *     slave, the new kernel driver), forks a shell on the slave so it gets a
 *     controlling terminal (job control, cooked mode, ^C -> SIGINT), and keeps
 *     the master;
 *   - keeps an in-memory character grid, runs a small VT/ANSI parser over the
 *     shell's output, and repaints changed lines by blitting glyphs DIRECTLY to
 *     the framebuffer via clgfx (GUI.md Model A direct-render): no pixels and no
 *     per-glyph traffic cross IPC, and a full-line scroll is one VRAM block copy;
 *   - remembers lines that scroll off the top in a malloc'd SCROLLBACK ring and
 *     shows them through a scrollbar on the LEFT edge of the content (see the
 *     scrollback + scrollbar sections below);
 *   - repaints on E_EXPOSE (redraw-on-expose), which is what keeps the terminal
 *     correct when uncovered after being partially covered -- only the cells
 *     the event's damage rect touches, so uncovering a strip costs the strip;
 *   - forwards E_KEY events from the server to the shell (master write).
 *
 * There is no select(2), so the two input sources - the master's output and the
 * server's event pipe - are multiplexed the V7 way (GUI.md sec 4.5): two dumb
 * pump children each blindly copy one source into a single "mux" pipe, and this
 * (single) main process blocks on one read() of the mux, owning all state.
