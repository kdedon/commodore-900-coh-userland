 * futex split used for the drawing lock above.
 *
 * The sleep/wake race is closed on BOTH sides: the client sets eq_wait before
 * its final emptiness test (hrlock.c hr_evwait), and here we re-test head!=tail
 * under sphi() before sleeping, so an event queued in between is seen rather
 * than slept through.  Interruptible (CVPIPE, below CVNOSIG) so a client that
 * also takes signals -- zclock's SIGALRM tick -- still gets them. */
